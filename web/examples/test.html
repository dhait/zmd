<p>This is the BirthdayBook specification, from <cites><a href="#spivey1992">Spivey</a></cites>.  We extend it slightly by
    adding an extra operation, <strong><em>RemindOne</em></strong>, that is non-deterministic.</p>
<div class="z-text">
    [ NAME , DATE ] <br/></div>
<p>The <strong>BirthdayBook</strong> schema defines the <em>state space</em> of
    the birthday book system.</p>
<div class="z-schema">
    <div class="z-name" >
        BirthdayBook
    </div>
    <div class="z-schema-decl">
        known : ℙ NAME <br/>birthday : NAME ⇸ DATE </div><div class="z-schema-pred">
    known = dom birthday </div></div>
<p>This <strong>InitBirthdayBook</strong> specifies the initial state
    of the birthday book system.  It does not say explicitly that
    <em>birthday</em> is empty, but that is implicit, because its domain
    is empty.</p>
<div class="z-schema">
    <div class="z-name" >
        InitBirthdayBook
    </div>
    <div class="z-schema-decl">
        BirthdayBook′ </div><div class="z-schema-pred">
    known′ = { } </div></div>
<p>Next we have several operation schemas to define the normal (non-error)
    behaviour of the system.</p>
<div class="z-schema">
    <div class="z-name" >
        AddBirthday
    </div>
    <div class="z-schema-decl">
        Δ BirthdayBook <br/>name? : NAME <br/>date? : DATE </div><div class="z-schema-pred">
    name? ∉ known <br/>birthday′ = birthday ∪ { name? ↦ date? } </div></div>
<div class="z-schema">
    <div class="z-name" >
        FindBirthday
    </div>
    <div class="z-schema-decl">
        Ξ BirthdayBook <br/>name? : NAME <br/>date! : DATE </div><div class="z-schema-pred">
    name? ∈ known <br/>date! = birthday ( name? ) </div></div>

<div class="z-schema">
    <div class="z-name" >
        Remind
    </div>
    <div class="z-schema-decl">
        Ξ BirthdayBook <br/>today? : DATE <br/>cards! : ℙ NAME </div><div class="z-schema-pred">
    cards! = { n : known | birthday ( n ) = today? } </div></div>


<p>This <strong>RemindOne</strong> schema does not appear in Spivey, but is
    included to show how non-deterministic schemas can be animated.
    It reminds us of just one person who has a birthday on the given
    day.</p>
<div class="z-schema">
    <div class="z-name" >
        RemindOne
    </div>
    <div class="z-schema-decl">
        Ξ BirthdayBook <br/>today? : DATE <br/>card! : NAME </div><div class="z-schema-pred">
    card! ∈ known <br/>birthday card! = today? </div></div>
<p>Now we strengthen the specification by adding error handling.</p>
<div class="z-text">
    REPORT ::= ok | already_known | not_known <br/></div>
<p>First we define auxiliary schemas that capture various success
    and error cases.</p>
<div class="z-schema">
    <div class="z-name" >
        Success
    </div>
    <div class="z-schema-decl">
        result! : REPORT </div><div class="z-schema-pred">
    result! = ok </div></div>
<div class="z-schema">
    <div class="z-name" >
        AlreadyKnown
    </div>
    <div class="z-schema-decl">
        Ξ BirthdayBook <br/>name? : NAME <br/>result! : REPORT </div><div class="z-schema-pred">
    name? ∈ known <br/>result! = already_known </div></div>
<div class="z-schema">
    <div class="z-name" >
        NotKnown
    </div>
    <div class="z-schema-decl">
        Ξ BirthdayBook <br/>name? : NAME <br/>result! : REPORT </div><div class="z-schema-pred">
    name? ∉ known <br/>result! = not_known </div></div>
<p>Finally, we define robust versions of all the operations
    by specifying how errors are handled.</p>
<div class="z-text">
    RAddBirthday == ( AddBirthday ∧ Success ) ∨ AlreadyKnown <br/></div>
<div class="z-text">
    RFindBirthday == ( FindBirthday ∧ Success ) ∨ NotKnown <br/></div>
<div class="z-text">
    RRemind == Remind ∧ Success <br/></div>
